# Image Processing Pipeline

This project is a comprehensive image processing pipeline built using Python and Streamlit. It performs various tasks on uploaded images, including segmentation, object identification, text extraction, attribute summarization, and data mapping. The processed data is visualized and displayed within a Streamlit web application.

## Project Overview

The pipeline processes uploaded images to:
1. **Segment** the image into different regions or objects.
2. **Identify** and classify objects within each segment.
3. **Extract text** from identified objects (if applicable).
4. **Summarize attributes** of the identified objects.
5. **Map** the summarized data into a structured format.
6. **Generate output** for visualization and further analysis.

## Features

- **Image Segmentation**: Divides images into segments for easier analysis.
- **Object Identification**: Classifies objects within segmented regions.
- **Text Extraction**: Extracts textual information from images.
- **Attribute Summarization**: Aggregates and summarizes object attributes.
- **Data Mapping**: Converts processed data into structured output.
- **Visualization**: Displays segmented images and extracted data within a Streamlit app.
